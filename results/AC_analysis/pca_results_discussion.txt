Principal component analysis (PCA) of the chemical space, colored by pIC50 values, reveals that activity cliffs (AC) are distributed throughout the entire chemical space, demonstrating that structurally similar molecules with significantly different potencies can occupy similar positions in the PCA-reduced space. This observation highlights the disruptive effect of activity cliffs on structure-activity relationship (SAR) learning, as conventional QSAR models assume that similar chemical structures exhibit similar biological activities, which is fundamentally violated by activity cliffs spanning the separation boundary between active and inactive regions.
